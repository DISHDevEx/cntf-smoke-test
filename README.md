# CNTF - Smoke Test

## Purpose
This source code repository stores the configurations to subscribe and connect a new UE to a 5g network and make multiple HTTP requests to webservers. This test will emulate HTTP requests across both 5G network and Ethernet interfaces, providing valuable baseline comparisons into the efficiency of data transmission and reception through these two mediums.

## Deployment
Prerequisites:

* *Please ensure that you have configured the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) to authenticate to an AWS environment where you have adequate permissions to create an EKS cluster, security groups and IAM roles* 
* *Please ensure that the pipeline in the "CNTF-Main" repository has been successfully deployed, as this ensures that all necessary components are available to support the execution of scripts in this repository.*  


Steps:
1. Create a fork of this repository and [Import](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html) it into Gitlab  
2. Perform a "Git clone" of this repository on your local machine
3. Set up a private Gitlab runner on the CNTF EKS cluster (***Note:*** *You only need to do this process once, this runner can be used by the other CNTF repositories you execute*):
    * In Gitlab, on the left side of the screen, hover over "settings" and select "CI/CD"
    * Next to "Runners" select "expand"
    * Unselect "Enable shared runners for this project"
    * Click "New project runner"
    * Under "Operating systems" select "Linux"
    * Fill out the "Tags" section and select "Run untagged jobs"
    * Scroll to the bottom and select "Create runner"
    * Copy and save the "runner token" listed under "Step 1"
    * Select "Go to runners page", you should now see your runner listed with a warning sign next to it under "Assigned project runners"
    * On your local terminal:
        * Install the helm gitlab repository: `helm repo add gitlab https://charts.gitlab.io`
        * intialize helm (for helm version 2): `helm init` 
        * create a namespace for your gitlab runner(s) in the cntf cluster: `kubectl create namespace <NAMESPACE (e.g. "gitlab-runners")>`
        * Install your created runner via helm: 
        `helm upgrade --install <RUNNER_NAME> -n <NAMESPACE> --set runnerRegistrationToken=<RUNNER_TOKEN> gitlabUrl=http://www.gitlab.com gitlab/gitlab-runner`
        * Check to see if your runner is working: `kubectl get pods -n <NAMESPACE>` (you should see "1/1" under "READY" and "Running" under "STATUS")
        * Give your runner cluster-wide permissions: `kubectl apply -f gitlab-runner-rbac.yaml`
    * In Gitlab, Under "Assigned project runners" you should now see that your runner has a green circle next to it, signaling a "ready" status
    * **How to re-use this runner for other CNTF repositories:**
        * Hover over "Settings" and select "CI/CD"
        * Under "Other available runners", find the runner you have created and select "Enable for this project"

4. Authenticate [Gitlab with AWS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/cloud_deployment/):
   * Inside of the Gitlab repository, hover over "Settings" and select "CI/CD"
   * Next to "Variables" select "Expand"
   * Select "Add variable"
   * Under "Key" type: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   * Under "Value", enter the value of your AWS Access key
   * Repeat steps 3-5 for `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)` with the correct corresponding values
5. Run the CI/CD pipeline:
    * On the left side of the screen click the drop-down arrow next to "Build" and select "Pipelines"
    * In the top right hand corner select "Run Pipeline"
    * In the drop-down under "Run for branch name or tag" select the appropriate branch name and click "Run Pipeline"
    * Once again, click the drop-down arrow next to "Build" and select "Pipelines", you should now see the pipeline being executed

## Pipeline Stages
Goal of each stage in the pipeline (refer to ".gitlab-ci.yml" for more details):
* "subscribe" - subscribes one UE to the network
* "test" - perform curls over network interfaces and ethernet
* "update_tests" - update test results locally and in AWS
* "cleanup" - removes create UE subscription from network database

## Coralogix Dashboards
To view parsed & visualized data resulting from tests run by various CNTF repositories, please visit CNTF's dedicated Coralogix tenant: https://dish-wireless-network.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MSS/pages/509509825/Coralogix+CNTF+Dashboards 
* Note: *You must have an individual account created by Coralogix to gain access to this tenant.*
    
Steps to view dashboards:
1. At the top of the page select the dropdown next to "Dashboards"
2. Select "Custom Dashboards" (All dashboards should have the tag "CNTF")

Raw data: To view raw data resulting from test runs, please look at the data stored in AWS S3 buckets dedicated to CNTF.
